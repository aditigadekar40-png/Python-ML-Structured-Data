# Structured and Unstructured Data ML 

## Overview
This repository contains experiments to study and perform various operations on structured and unstructured data using Python. The experiments are done in Google Colab.

## Theory / Background

### Structured Data
Structured data is data that is organized in a predefined format, typically rows and columns.
Common examples include:
- CSV (Comma Separated Values)
- Microsoft Excel
- Google Sheets

Operations on structured data include:
- Data cleaning
- Filtering and sorting
- Aggregation and summarization
- Statistical analysis

### Unstructured Data
Unstructured data does not follow a predefined format or structure.
Examples include:
- Text documents
- Images
- Audio and video files
- JSON or XML files

Operations on unstructured data may include:
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)
- Image processing (resizing, normalization)
- Feature extraction for ML models

### Python Notebooks
Python notebooks are an interactive environment for coding, documentation, and visualization.
Benefits include:
- Step-by-step execution
- Easy visualization of results
- Integrated documentation and code

### Machine Learning Experiments
In this project, ML experiments are performed on structured and unstructured datasets using Python.
Key tasks include:
- Data exploration and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualization of results
- Experimentation with different ML algorithms

## Libraries Used
- **Data Manipulation:** pandas, numpy
- **Data Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** scikit-learn
- **Others:** warnings, os, datetime (if needed)
